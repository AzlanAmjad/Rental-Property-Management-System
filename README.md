### Rental Property Management System
This is a class project for ENSF 480 (Principles of Software Design) at the University of Calgary. The purpose of this project was to practice a complete process of design and development of a large software application, with a focus on system level design and architecture. This application is a Rental Property Management System named RentSlower. The project requirements document and design document can be found under the *Project Documents* directory.

## How do I run the application?
Firstly, make sure you have MySQL DBMS installed on your machine

Secondly, create a MySQL user with **Username: test** and **Password: testpass123**. Grant all privileges to this user (trust me :pleading_face:). Then create a MySQL database using the provided .sql file.

This repository contains the RentSlower.jar file, download and open this file, the application should be up and running! :partying_face:

## Requirements
- OpenJDK 11
- MySQL (Username: test, Password: testpass123)
